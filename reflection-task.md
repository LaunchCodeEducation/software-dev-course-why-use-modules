As you think about the concepts of modular code and external modules, take a moment to reflect on the following questions:

  1. Benefits of Modular Code: Why do you think modular code is important for building complex applications? How do you think it improves collaboration, debugging, and reusability in programming?
  
  2. Applying Modular Concepts: Imagine a large project you might work on, like a weather app or a quiz game. How could dividing the project into modules make it more manageable? What kinds of functionality would you separate into modules?

  3. Using External Modules: How do you think external modules, like pre-written libraries, could save time and effort in your development process? Can you think of a task where using an external module might be especially useful?

Write a short reflection addressing these questions. Focus on how you see these ideas fitting into your journey as a developer and how they might shape the way you approach future coding projects.
